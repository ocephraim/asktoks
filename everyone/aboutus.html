                <p>At asktoks.com we believe we can change the world's response to autism and mental health issues. We believe we can create a world that understands autism, thinks positively about developmental disorders, finds opportunities and builds on strengths, does not judge, disregard or outcast its children because of their mental ability. By sharing the information we have, we are helping to break down stigma and neutralise fear. We do this because changing perceptions is only possible through education and shared information.</p>
                <p>asktoks.com was created because one person alone cannot physically reach the thousands that need our help, but a great number of those thousands can reach our site.</p>

                <p>After nearly a decade in the UK, studying and working for a community interest organisation that researches treatment for children with autism, in 2013 she took her expertise around the world with particular emphasis on Western and Southern Africa. She spent the year analysing education provision for disadvantaged and challenged children throughout Africa.

                <p>Ms Bakareâ€™s commitment to improving quality education for children with special education needs in the country has translated to thousands of hours of practical training in ABA.

Through her unrelenting advocacy campaigns, her public training programs and her highly skilled clinical treatments, this young woman is changing the lives of the millions of misunderstood neglected and under-served African children living with the burden of neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>
