                        <h3>What is Autism?</h3>
                        <p>The umbrella term Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) covers conditions such as autism,childhood disintegrative disorder and Asperger syndrome. Autism is a developmental disorder with onset in infancy. Like other developmental disorders, it is characterized by impairment in functions related to the central nervous system. To different degrees children may have difficulty with speaking, making eye-contact, understanding others, understanding feelings, being sociable, co-ordination, bright lights and bright noises. Interventions that address these areas help improve behaviour and quality of life. You cannot always tell that a child has an ASD just by looking at them.</p> 
                        <p>Autism can also mean a child is talented, loving, unique, blessed, sensitive, happy, exceptional and human. Some individuals with ASDs have varying degrees of abilities that could potentially lead to independent and productive life with varying levels of support. Others may be more severely affected and require life-long care and support.</p>

                        <h3>Diagnosis and Treatment</h3>
                        <p>Asktoks.com provides applied behavioural analysis services to individual families, educational and healthcare institutions. Serving children that need a little more</p>
                        <p>We develop and implement effective behavioural interventions using the principles of Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA) for children with autism spectrum disorders and other developmental disorders. ABA is as science of behaviour that enables us to think positively about developmental disorders, find opportunities for learning and build on strengths. It is an evidence based intervention used to treat mental and developmental disorders like addiction, schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders, and other non-diagnosed behavioural difficulties. ABA has also been used in other disciplines such as sports, business and organisation management as well as in education.</p>
                        <p> When behavioural treatment services are required for a child who is not learning at a similar rate to their peers, your first step is to have the necessary assessments that will determine further course of action and a potential treatment plan. The next step is to begin treatment. Your ABA program will focus on increasing certain behaviours the child may not be exhibiting, these can include language and communication behaviours, academic skill and certain social skills. It will also aim to reduce any unwanted behaviours the child may be expressing such as excessive tantrums and stereotypical behaviours.

                                <p>ADHD is oone of the most common neurobehaviourall disorders. It is characterized by problems with inattentiveness, over-activity,impulsivity, or a combination. For these problems to be diagnosed as AD/HD, they must be out of the normal range for the child's age and development. It is usually first diagnosed in childhood and often persists into adulthood. Diagnosis can be made reliably using well-tested diagnostic interview methods. Treatment may include medical, educational, behavioral, and/or psychological interventions. ADHD is a lifelong disorder that can negatively impair many aspects of daily life if not treated, including home, school, work, and interpersonal relationships. </p>

                                <p>Angelman Syndrome is a genetic disorder in which a gene on chromosome 15 is missing or unexpressed. Children with Angelman Syndrome typically have developmental delays that are frequently evident between 6-12 months of age. Diagnosis can be established through genetic and DNA testing as early as the first year of life.  In affected children, language comprehension and non-verbal skills are usually more developed than spoken language and the affected child may have few if any words. Children with Angelman Syndrome have difficulties with movement and balance.  Their behavior may combine frequent laughter and smiling, an easily excitable personality, hand flapping movements, hyperactive behavior, and a short attention span.  Associated physical features and concerns, such as seizures, movement problems, hypopigmentation, sleep and feeding problems, are present in about 20-80% of children who have this disorder. Many educational and behavioral interventions have been shown to be effective in addition to physical and occupational therapies, speech and language interventions, behavior modification, and parent training.</p>

                                <p>Cerebral palsy is a disorder caused by damage to the brain that occurs before, during, or shortly following birth. It affects body movement and muscle coordination. Individuals with cerebral palsy may also experience seizures, abnormal speech, hearing and visual impairments, and mental retardation. Children with cerebral palsy may not be able to walk, talk, eat, or play in the same ways as most other children. Cerebral palsy can include milder versions or more severe symptoms which lead to total dependency. Although cerebral palsy is a lifelong condition, training and therapy can help improve function.</p>

                                <p>Down Syndrome is a chromosomal abnormality that changes the course of development and causes the characteristics associated with the syndrome. Mild to severe mental retardation can be present among those affected. Speech and language may also be delayed. The diagnosis is usually suspected at birth due to the presence of physical characteristics such as a large tongue, heart problems, poor muscle tone, and flat facial features. The diagnosis is confirmed through chromosomal testing. The disorder is associated with a lifelong disability but can be treated through a variety of appropriate educational and behavioral interventions in addition to occupational therapies, speech and language interventions, behavior modification, and parent training.</p>
