                <p>Contrary to popular thought, affordable treatment services are available in Nigeria. Although somewhat limited, there are viable options for educating your child at home, without the need to travel abroad. </p>
                
                <h3>Behavioural</h3>
                <p>We develop and implement effective behavioural interventions using the principles of Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA)for children with autism spectrum disorders and other developmental disorders. </p>
                <p>ABA is as science of behaviour that enables us to think positively about developmental disorders, find opportunities for learning and build on strengths. It is an evidence based intervention used to treat mental and developmental disorders like addiction, schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders, and other non-diagnosed behavioural difficulties. The techniques of ABA has also been used in other disciplines such as sports, business and organisation management as well as in education.</p>
                <p>When behavioural treatment services are required for a child who is not learning at a similar rate to their peers, your first step is to have the necessary assessments that will determine further course of action and a potential treatment plan.</p>
                <p>The next step is to begin treatment. Your ABA program will focus on increasing certain behaviours the child may not be exhibiting, these can include language and communication behaviours, academic skill and certain social skills. It will also aim to reduce any unwanted behaviours the child may be expressing such as excessive tantrums and stereotypical behaviours.</p>
                <p> <a href="contacts.html">Contact us now </a> for further information on how we can provide you with behavioural treatment services.</p>
                <hr>
                <h3>Private</h3>
                <p>We provide private consultations with optional follow ups for parents who may already be seeking services elsewhere. The purpose of the consultations is to listen to your concerns, meet your child and provide professional behavioural advice based on clinically researched interventions and over a decade of experience in the field. Consultations are currently being provided in the child’s home and/or child’s school. Alternatively, consultations can also be provided at our offices in Lekki and in Ikeja.</p>
                <hr>
                <h3>After</h3>
                <p>This service is provided for children with special educational needs who wish to attend an inclusive after school clubs like gymnastics, ballet and music with their peers. We equip parents and careers with the tools to support their child through the after school club, ensuring that the child is learning from the class instructor, in an enriched environment with positive role models.</p>
                <hr>
                <h3>Bespoke</h3>
                <p>We design treatment plans for individuals based on the resources available to them. This means after extensive interviews, visits with the child and general assessments, we advise on how to and what help to seek according to what is within the family’s means and what is available in their area.</p>

                <p>We train individuals and groups of people in behavioural techniques necessary for dealing with people with autism spectrum disorders and other developmental disorders.

                <p><strong>Training for SEN schools, units and centres</strong> includes: using the principles of ABA as based on operant conditioning to teach children with developmental disorders (increasing behaviours and decreasing behaviours).</p>
                <p><strong>Training for employers and colleagues of adults with  autism</strong>  includes: the benefits of having a person with autism at work, how to make the working environment autism friendly, interacting with an adult with autism – what to say and how to respond, things to be aware of when dealing with a person with autism – e.g. things that can be upsetting or difficult for them.</p>
                <p><strong>Training for community figures, religious leaders and traditional gatekeepers</strong> includes: the message you should be giving out to your community, how to respond when someone brings a child with a problem to you, is it ok to refer them to a doctor?, what to do with your congregation (having extra hands in Sunday school, how to keep their attention etc.)</p>

                <p>As well as our website, we provide information packages about autism and other developmental disorders that are distributed in communities across the country under various autism awareness campaigns. The information is used by government and non-government organisations, by individuals and by small groups and communities. The packages are designed to meet the needs of different groups so contain different information for each.</p>
                <p>Each package informs on what autism is and the next steps that need to be taken. Further to this and if commissioned, information packages inform on identification, diagnosis and assessment procedures; treatment, therapies and management of the condition; early intervention protocol and industry guidelines; education and employment of persons with autism.</p>
                <p>Information is delivered on various platforms, depending on the audience. We compile information that is delivered through face-to-face contact for small groups and communities for example. The face-to-face platform includes talks, seminars, presentations, formal and less formal meetings or gatherings, one on one, focus groups and so on. We also create recorded content for television programs (news, health, and infomercials), radio shows, advertisements and internet content through the website.</p>
