                    <h3>What is Autism?</h3>
                    <p>Every individual with autism is just that; individual and unlike any other. In our experience at asktoks.com, people with autism are talented, loving, unique, blessed, intelligent, sensitive, happy, exceptional and of course extremely interesting.</p>
                    <p>You should also know that, the umbrella term Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) covers conditions such as autism, childhood disintegrative disorder and Asperger Syndrome. ASD is a developmental disorder with onset in infancy.</p>
                    <span id="more" class="more1">
                        <p>Like other developmental disorders, it is characterised by impairment in functions related to the central nervous system which can be characterised in three main ways.</p>
                        <div class="jumbotron p-3"> 
                            <p class="small">One of the ways autism affects people is in the way the person is able to relate to, or <strong>interact with other people.</strong> To different degrees, some people with autism, may have difficulty understanding others. For example, for children this can translate to difficulty making eye-contact or playing with other children the way they want to play. While for some adults with autism, it can mean difficulty being sociable or understanding feelings. </p> 
                            <p class="small">Another way autism can affect an individual is in the person’s ability to <strong>develop language and communication skills.</strong> For some people with autism, casual conversation can be uninteresting and sometimes quite difficult, and for others being able to explain what they need or want can also be quite difficult.</p>
                            <p class="small">A third major symptom of autism is shown in the person’s interests and mannerisms.  Some people with autism will experience limited interests or restrictive behaviours.</p>
                            <p class="small">Interventions that address these areas help improve behaviour and quality of life.</p>
                        </div><!--jumbotron-->
                        <p>There is much more to autism than these three characteristics, it is important to remember that autism is a spectrum, which means people are affected in different ways and to different degrees. Some individuals with ASDs have varying degrees of abilities that could potentially lead to independent and productive life with varying levels of support. Others may be more severely affected and require life-long care and support. <br> <br> You cannot always tell that a child has an ASD just by looking at them. <br> <br> Be autism aware because changing perceptions starts with your education. <br> <br> If you have any concerns about your child’s development or are simply curious about autism spectrum disorders, speak up now in confidence, help is available. <a href="contacts.html">Contact us here</a></p>

It is a widely-researched, evidence-based intervention used to treat mental and developmental disorders like autism spectrum disorders, and other non-diagnosed behavioural difficulties. </p>

                            <p>ADHD is common in children with Autism Spectrum Disorders but can also be diagnosed in isolation. At asktoks.com we recognise multiple intelligences in all children and value an individual’s potential to have musical intelligence (ability to skilfully perform, compose and appreciate music), interpersonal intelligence (ability to establish rapport others and make friends easily) as well as kinesthetic intelligence (ability to use the body to skilfully convey ideas and feelings) despite an ADHD diagnosis.</p>
                            <p>ADHD can be characterised by a difficulty with staying attentive to a task, difficulty with being organised. It can also be characterised by frequent over-activity and impulsiveness, or a combination of these symptoms. </p>
                            <p>For these symptoms to be diagnosed as ADHD, they must be out of the normal range for the child's age and development. Symptoms would typically have been present from an early age (before about 12), they would cause observable difficulty in school or at work as well as at home. Sometimes symptoms can also lead to difficulty maintaining interpersonal relationships.</p>
                            <p>ADHD is usually first diagnosed in childhood and often persists into adulthood. Diagnosis can be made reliably using well-tested diagnostic interview methods. Treatment may include medical, educational, behavioural, and/or psychological interventions. ADHD is a lifelong disorder that can negatively impair many aspects of daily life if not treated, however treatment is available and many people with ADHD live healthy and productive lives.

Children with cerebral palsy may not be able to walk, talk, eat, or play in the same ways as others. Like other developmental disorders, the symptoms of cerebral palsy can either be milder (low dependency) or more severe (high or total dependency). </p>
